Thread Synchronization - multi threads interact with a shared global list without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions.
Stopping Criteria - Detemining when to stop and thread can be complex.
Concurrency Control - Coordinating the execution of multiple threads with different tasks, especially when they depend on the state of the global list, requires careful design and coordination to prevent deadlocks or contention.
Bottlenecks -  running multiple threads concurrently can lead to performance bottlenecks.
